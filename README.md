# 📖 iPad E-Ink Mode Shortcut

Transform your iPad's high-energy LED display into a low-strain, grayscale reading environment. This shortcut mimics the visual properties of an E-Ink display by stripping color, reducing light intensity, and warming the screen temperature.

## ✨ Features
* **Grayscale Conversion:** Removes all color to reduce digital stimulation and eye fatigue.
* **White Point Reduction:** Dims the "glow" of the pixels themselves, making white backgrounds look like grey paper.
* **Blue Light Filter:** Activates maximum Night Shift warmth to protect your circadian rhythm.
* **Universal Toggle:** Use a single command to switch between "Reading" and "Standard" modes.

## 🚀 Installation

1.  **Download:** Download the `.shortcut` file from this repository or use your generated iCloud Link.
2.  **Initial Calibration (Important):** Shortcuts will toggle the setting, but you need to set the *intensity* manually once:
    * Go to **Settings > Accessibility > Display & Text Size**.
    * Turn on **Reduce White Point** and set the slider to **85%**.
    * Turn it back off. The shortcut will now remember this 85% level every time it runs.

## 🗣️ Setup Intuitive Voice Commands

Siri works best when you have specific names for your commands. To avoid "Toggle" confusion, create **Alias Shortcuts**:

1.  Create a new shortcut named **"Normal Mode"**.
2.  Add the action **"Run Shortcut"** and select **E-ink Mode**.
3.  Create another named **"Turn off E-ink"** and do the same.

**Now you can say:**
* *"Hey Siri, E-ink Mode"* (To activate)
* *"Hey Siri, Normal Mode"* (To deactivate)

## 🛠️ Hardware Synergy
For the most authentic experience, use this shortcut in combination with a **Matte/Paper-like screen protector**. This removes the glass glare that E-ink screens don't have, making the display much easier on the eyes under overhead lighting.
